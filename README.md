This tool makes **macOS Sequoia run faster** on older Macs — especially machines running **OpenCore Legacy Patcher**.  
If your Mac is slow, laggy, stuttering, or overheating on Sequoia, this optimizer helps clean up background processes and makes your system more responsive.

The entire suite is packaged inside a simple `.app` file you can run immediately.
